## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Access Responsive Website (Priority: P1)

As a web user, I want to access a comprehensive, modern website that displays programming language information responsively across all devices to learn about and compare programming languages.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary user interface for the majority of users accessing the platform via web browsers, delivering core value through information access.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the website on various devices and screen sizes, verifying content display and navigation functionality without requiring mobile apps or backend features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the website on a desktop browser, **When** they navigate to language pages, **Then** content displays properly with responsive layout
2. **Given** a user opens the website on a mobile browser, **When** they interact with components, **Then** the interface adapts to touch and small screens
3. **Given** a user has slow internet, **When** they access the site, **Then** content loads progressively without blocking user interaction

### User Story 2 - Use Mobile Applications (Priority: P2)

As a mobile user, I want native applications on Android and iOS that provide the same comprehensive programming language information with optimized mobile performance and offline capabilities.

**Why this priority**: Mobile users represent a significant portion of users who need dedicated apps for better user experience and offline access.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing and using the apps on target devices, verifying core functionality works offline and with mobile-specific interactions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user installs the Android app, **When** they launch it, **Then** they can browse languages and view details
2. **Given** a user installs the iOS app, **When** they use it offline, **Then** previously loaded content remains accessible
3. **Given** a user on mobile, **When** they perform actions, **Then** the app responds with native performance

---

### User Story 3 - Deploy and Maintain System (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want to deploy the full-stack system using specified tools and maintain it with proper monitoring and updates.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the system can be reliably deployed and maintained, supporting long-term operation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying to staging environments and verifying all components work together.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code is ready, **When** deploying frontend to Vercel, **Then** website becomes available
2. **Given** backend code, **When** deploying to Railway/Render/AWS, **Then** API endpoints are accessible
3. **Given** deployed system, **When** monitoring, **Then** performance metrics are available

### Edge Cases

- What happens when users access the website on very old browsers or devices?
- How does the system handle network failures during data loading?
- What occurs when mobile apps are used on devices with limited storage?
- How are large datasets of programming languages handled for performance?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a responsive web interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices
- **FR-002**: System MUST deliver comprehensive programming language information including comparisons and career paths
- **FR-003**: System MUST offer native mobile applications for Android and iOS platforms
- **FR-004**: System MUST include a backend API for data operations and user interactions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a marketing landing page optimized for SEO
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist user preferences and interaction data
- **FR-007**: System MUST support offline access to core content in mobile applications
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure accessibility compliance across all interfaces

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Programming Language**: Represents individual programming languages with attributes like name, description, popularity, salary ranges, and use cases
- **User**: Represents system users with preferences and interaction history
- **Career Path**: Represents career progression information related to programming languages
- **Comparison Data**: Represents comparative metrics between programming languages

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can access the website and load content in under 3 seconds on standard internet connections
- **SC-002**: Mobile applications support 95% of target Android and iOS devices without performance issues
- **SC-003**: System handles at least 1000 concurrent users without degradation in response times
- **SC-004**: 90% of users can successfully complete primary tasks (viewing language info, comparisons) on first attempt
- **SC-005**: Mobile apps maintain functionality for at least 24 hours of offline use after initial data sync

## Assumptions

- Standard web and mobile development practices apply for unspecified technical details
- Target users have modern devices capable of running current OS versions
- Internet connectivity is available for initial data loading and synchronization
- Content will be provided in English as primary language
- Basic user authentication may be required for personalized features
