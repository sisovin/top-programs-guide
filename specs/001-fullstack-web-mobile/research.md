# Research Findings: Full Stack Web and Mobile Application

**Feature**: 001-fullstack-web-mobile
**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Researcher**: speckit.plan

## Testing Framework Selection

**Decision**: Jest for unit and integration testing across TypeScript/Node.js components, Cypress for end-to-end web testing, PHPUnit for PHP landing page, JUnit/XCTest for mobile platforms.

**Rationale**:

- Jest provides excellent TypeScript support with built-in mocking and coverage reporting, aligning with strict mode requirements
- Cypress offers reliable browser automation for testing the Next.js frontend user flows
- PHPUnit is the standard for PHP testing, ensuring compatibility with PHP 8.4.5
- Platform-specific testing (JUnit for Android Kotlin, XCTest for iOS Swift) leverages native testing frameworks for KMM-generated code
- All frameworks support CI/CD integration and provide comprehensive reporting

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Vitest: Faster execution but less mature ecosystem for large projects
- Playwright: More powerful browser automation but steeper learning curve than Cypress
- Mocha/Chai: Traditional but requires more setup than Jest's zero-config approach
- Espresso/UI Automator: Android-specific but JUnit provides better cross-platform consistency

**Implementation Notes**:

- Jest configuration will include TypeScript support and coverage thresholds (90%+ for controllers)
- Cypress tests will focus on critical user journeys from the spec
- Mobile tests will prioritize shared KMM logic with platform-specific UI tests
- All tests will run in CI pipeline with parallel execution for performance
